This project is the fifth C language project in the Alx software engineering course.

In this project, we are still working on the concepts of functions, nested loops but going even deeper.
This project is composed of 10 tasks and 2 optional tasks.

To help us, you can make suggestions, contribute documents or add links to resources that can help us learn more.

Thanks in advance.
