Low level programming with the C language 

This project aims to master the communication with the computer and the use of the C language as a low level language.
Through this project, we aspire to master the C language in all its forms in order to apply it in situations of our daily life that require such a powerful language.

It is an interesting project in the sense that the C language is very powerful and most of the languages such as Java, JavaScript, Ruby etc... are languages built on this language. Its knowledge will be really useful to all those who want to evolve in the software development field.

To participate you can make suggestions, bring documents or add links to resources that can help us in the same direction. 

We thank you in advance.
