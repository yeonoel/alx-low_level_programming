This project is the sixth project in C language of the Alx software engineering course.

In this project, we are still working on the concepts of pointers, arrays and strings, but we are going deeper.
This project is composed of 9 tasks and 2 optional tasks.

To help us, you can make suggestions, contribute documents or add links to resources that can help us learn more.

Thanks in advance.
