Repository of learning the C language 

This repository concerns the learning of the C language within the framework of the ALX software engineering studies.

It concerns only everything that is related to the C language.


It is an interesting project in the sense that the C language is very powerful and most languages such as Java, JavaScript, Ruby etc... are languages built on this language. His knowledge will be really useful to all those who want to evolve in the field of software development.

To participate, you can make suggestions, bring documents or add links to resources that can help us in the same direction. 

We thank you in advance.
